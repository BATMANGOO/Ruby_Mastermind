      How to play Mastermind:\n
      You first choose to be either the code #{'MAKER'.red} or code #{'BREAKER'.red}.

      The code #{'BREAKER'.red} will have 12 turns to decipher the code that the #{'MAKER'.red} has created.

      The code consists of 4 digits, each digit ranging from 1-6.

      Feedback will be given with each entry to show how close the guess was to the hidden code.

      When guessing a correct number that is also in the correct position you will get an #{'X'.blue} and if the guess contains a correct number but is not in the correct position, you will get a #{'O'.yellow}. The hints do not help to tell you where the correct number is placed.

      Good Luck Code Breaker!\n\n
